##Telegraph prep part 1 self-assessment
**This is solo work do not ask others for help**

###String: 'Javascript is super duper awesome'
###Object: myProfileObject = {};
###Array: javaScriptArray = ['J', 'a', 'v', 'a'];


####1. Print to the Javascript console the 5 letter in a string (no variables allowed)

####2. Loop through a string and print each character to the Javascript console (the only variable allowed is the iterator)

####3. Copy and refactor problem 2 using a `while` loop

####4. Add to `myProfileObject` the properties and values ('key, value pairs'): 
  1. 'school' set to 'Telegraph Prep'
  2. 'location' set to 'Berkeley, California'
  3. 'name' set to your name

  **NOTE: Explain the method you are using to do this (hint: '_____, notation')**

####5. Create a function that takes, an object and a name as parameters. It will return a new object with ONLY these properties:
  1. Your first and last name ex: **`name`: `'Bobby Tables'`**
  2. Your `place of birth`: city, state (or equivalent), country
  3. Your `hobby` or favorite activity
  4. A method that prints: 'My first name is [first name]' and my last name is '[last name]'
    - This method must use the 

**NOTE: test your function by passing in the `myProfileObject` as a parameter and console.log the result**

####6. Create a function that takes a name as an parameter and returns `true` if it is equivalent to the `name` property returned from the function call above.

####7. Create a function that takes an object as a parameter and returns the `length` of the object

####8. Create a function that modifies the `javaScriptArray` to be filled with `['J', 'a', 'v', 'a', 'S', 'c', 'r', 'i', 'p', 't']`

####9. Create a function that modifies the `javaScriptArray` and returns a NEW array with `['JavaScript']`


**Must include:**
- pseudocode
- proper indentation '2 spaces' not tabs
- Remove and unnecessary `console.log` statements

##Algorithm Design
1. Define the rules of the problem
2. Determine any constraints
3. Explore the problem and discover techniques or patterns that might be useful
4. Generate a simple plan that should solve the problem
5. Turn that plan into steps- put your pseudocode skills to use!
